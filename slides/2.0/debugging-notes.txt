Debugging
- make sure enableProdMode() not turned on. Console should say "Angular is running in the development mode. Call enableProdMode() to enable the production mode."
- make sure sourcemaps === true in tsconfig.json
- install Augury. This is a Chrome extension that allows you to browse Angular components & modules
- add the 'debugger' keyword to source code to force a breakpoint
- use the 'json' pipe to observe model details in real time
- consider using angular2-logger (npm package)

Building for prod
- remember, it's 'npm run build'. 'npm build' is an internal npm command that will not do what you want. 

ng cli
- buggy
- super buggy
- still in beta
- 'ng help' doesn't work 
- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4338
- 'npm install -g @angular/cli'
- permissions error? 'sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local'
- try 'ng help'
